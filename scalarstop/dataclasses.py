"""
A forked version of the Python :py:mod:`dataclasses` module.

Create a dataclass with the decorator ``@sp.dataclass`` as follows::

    import scalarstop as sp

    @sp.dataclass
    class Hyperparams(sp.HyperparamsType):
        val1: int
        val2: str


The Python :py:mod:`dataclasses` module uses singletons to compare
certain values in internal code. This makes it difficult to
:py:mod:`cloudpickle` a dataclass and then unpickle it.

This version of the :py:mod:`dataclasses` module is better-designed
to be shared across different Python processes.
